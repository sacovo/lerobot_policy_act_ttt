    """Creates the pre- and post-processing pipelines for the ACT policy.

    The pre-processing pipeline handles normalization, batching, and device placement for the model inputs.
    The post-processing pipeline handles unnormalization and moves the model outputs back to the CPU.

    Args:
        config (ACTConfig): The ACT policy configuration object.
        dataset_stats (dict[str, dict[str, torch.Tensor]] | None): A dictionary containing dataset
            statistics (e.g., mean and std) used for normalization. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        tuple[PolicyProcessorPipeline[dict[str, Any], dict[str, Any]], PolicyProcessorPipeline[PolicyAction, PolicyAction]]: A tuple containing the
        pre-processor pipeline and the post-processor pipeline.
